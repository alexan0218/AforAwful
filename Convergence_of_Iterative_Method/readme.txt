Introduction for Math 2605 project part two:

Written by : An Jihai , Alan Jiang

This part is written in Java and can be run from command lines.

You can find all required data records at locations below:

1.The randomly generated 100 vectors would be shown on the console 
(because it is generated by method 'System.out.print()')

2.The Average Error of jacobi can be found in the text file at the root directory of part two
  "Convergence_of_Iterative_Method" (File: "Convergence_of_iterative_methods.txt")

  javac *.java -> java IterativeMethods 

  By doing this, the txt file will be generated 

3.The Average Error of gauss_seidel can be found in the text file at the root directory of part two
  "Convergence_of_Iterative_Method" (File: "Convergence_of_iterative_methods.txt")

3.The Average Error of average ration of iterations of jacobi and gauss_seidel can be found in a text file at the root directory of part two
  "Convergence_of_Iterative_Method" (File: "Convergence_of_iterative_methods.txt")

4.The scatterplot chart is in the Excel file ("Convergence of iterative methods data.xlsx")

5.The written part is in the Word file ("Convergence_of_iterative_methods.docx")

6.javac *.java -> java IterativeMethods 

  By doing this, a txt file will be generated
