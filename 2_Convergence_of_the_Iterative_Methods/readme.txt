Introduction for Math 2605 project part two:

Written by : An Jihai , Alan Jiang

This part is written in Java and can be run from command lines.

You can find all required data records at locations below:

1.The randomly generated 100 vectors would be shown on the console 
(because it is generated by method 'System.out.print()')

2.The Average Error of jacobi can be found in the text file at the root directory of part two
  "Convergence_of_Iterative_Method" (File: "Convergence_of_iterative_methods.txt")

  javac *.java -> java IterativeMethods 

  By doing this, the txt file will be generated 
===============================================================================
All date generated and collected were in the Excel file ("Convergence of iterative methods data.xlsx")
You can directly check it if you don't want to spend time on examine the console
Also, the scatterplot was in the Excel file as well. Since all initial vectors are generated randomly,
the generated file may contain different data from data in Excel file.
==================================================================================


3. To test jacobi and gauss_seidel methods :
	
	javac *.java -> java TestIterations fileName Tolerance MaxIterations


5.The written part is in the Word file ("Convergence_of_iterative_methods.docx")
