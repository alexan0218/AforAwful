You can find all required data records at locations below:

1.To test lu_fact, qr_facthouseh, and qr_fact_givens functions : 
		
	javac *.java  -> java TestDecomposition testfilename.dat

2. To test solve_lu_b and solve_qr_b functions :
		
	javac *.java -> java TestSolutions testfilename.dat

3. To get the Pascal Matrix all operations' outputs:

	javac *.java -> java PascalMatrix 

  a txt file will be generated and all solutions and errors 

  are in that file with readable alignment. 


4.The plot was in the "Pascal_Matrix.xlsx"

5.The written part was in "Pascal_Matrix.docx"
